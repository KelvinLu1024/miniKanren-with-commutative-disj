## Towards a miniKanren with fair search strategies

Hello everyone, I am Kuang-Chen, from Indiana University. It is my pleasure 
to be at the first miniKanren workshop. Today I am going to talk about our 
paper, "Towards a miniKanren with fair search strategies." done jointly with 
Weixi Ma, and Dan Friedmen.

## Content

Our presentation has five parts.

First, let's begin with the Background.

=== Background ===

## The Reasoned Schemer, 2nd Edition

miniKanren is a family of programming languages.  And our research is 
done with the miniKanren in this little yellow-green book, TRS2. We chose 
this implementation because it was my first introduction to miniKanren.

## Commandments for miniKanren Programmers

When I was introduced to miniKanren, I learned a few commandments.

The most memorable one is: within each sequence of goals, move 
non-recursive goals before recursive goals.

Then I heard in my class that if your miniKanren program is slow, 
fiddle with its conde-lines.

Sometimes the program might even seem non-terminating because it is so slow.

I guess many people in this room have played the game of permuting conde-lines.

The reason why we sometimes have to play this game is that interleaving DFS, 
the search strategy in the little yellow-green book and microKanren, allocates 
half of the computational resources to the first conde-line, a quarter to the 
second line, one-eighth to the third, and so on.  So when a conde expression has 
many lines, the last few lines are hardly explored.

In other words, this search strategy has unfair disjunctions.

This unfair behavior is sometimes powerful as it allows us to control the 
priority of each conde-line.

In some cases, however, it might not be the best choice.

## Cases where we might want a fair strategy

At least in these cases, we might want strategies to allocate resources more 
evenly to every conde-line.

- teaching new miniKanren programmers

If strategies allocate computational resources evenly to every conde-line, 
beginners may be able to ignore conde-line order.  
Besides, it is intractable to figure out the optimal line order without 
heuristics.

- writing relational definitions that run in different running modes

miniKanren programmers sometimes run a relation in several running modes.  Some 
people call it running forwards and backwards.  But the optimal order for each 
mode can be different.  Sometimes, the optimal order for one mode can be the 
worst order for another mode.  If strategies allocate computational resources 
evenly to every conde-line, we might be able to use one definition for 
different running modes while obtaining less pessimistic performance.

=== Contributions ===

Now let's move on to our contributions.

## Fairness
 
First, we analyze fairness.

We think there are two aspects of fairness:

* fairness in disjunctions, and

* fairness in conjunctions

We have three levels of fairness in disjunctions:

  unfair, 

  almost-fair, 

  or fair.

And we have two levels of fairness in conjunctions:

  unfair

  or fair.

We will elaborate on these later.

## Search Strategies

Here are all 4 search strategies that we have analyzed.
Interleaving DFS is the search strategy in the little yellow-green book.

(next slide)

Balanced interleaving DFS and fair DFS are new.

We give a new implementation of BFS, described in "Algebra of Logic 
Programming".  Our implementation is shorter and more efficient.

=== The Behavior of Strategies ===

We can look at the behavior of these strategies by running some programs.

## 

Our example programs are about running this relation, repeato.
repeato takes two arguments, `x' and `l',
where `x' is an arbitrary term.
and   `l' is a list of one or more `x's.

For example, here we ask for 3 `q's such that each `q' is a list of 
one or more lambdas. We get three answers:

a list of one lambda,

a list of two lambdas, and

a list of three lambdas.

## Interleaving DFS (Unfair Disjunction)

Sometimes we want lists of things other than lambdas, like, lambs!
Here we ask for 15 `q's such that each `q' is either a list of lambdas, a 
list of white lambs, a list of grey lambs, a list of cats, or a list of dogs.

Interleaving DFS, which has unfair disjunction, gives us far more lambdas than 
animals.

We cannot find a list of cats or a list of dogs in the first 15 answers.

So miniKanren programmers sometimes need to be very careful about the order of 
their conde-lines.

## Balanced-interleaving DFS (Almost-fair Disjunction)

In constrast, if we were to ask the same question with our almost-fair 
disjunction, we would get a more diverse collection of answers.  We can see all 
sorts of lists in the first 15 answers.

If we look closer to the answer list, we can see a pattern: the first four 
answers are a white lamb, a gray lamb, a cat, and a lambda.  The next four 
answers are, again, white lambs, gray lambs, cats, and (pause) dogs!  And the 
next four answers repeat the pattern.  So the last answer in the third line is a 
list of two lambdas.  And if we ask for one more answer, it would be a list of 
two dogs.

The pattern here is that for every four answers, the first three answers are 
respectively, white lambs, gray lambs, and cats, lambdas and dogs appear 
alternatively at the last position.

Almost-fair disjunctions guarantee that the maximal ratio of computational 
resources spent in each conde-line is bounded by a constant, no matter how many 
lines there are. The constant for our almost-fair strategy is 2.

If you are curious about why we have so few lambdas, I will explain that 
later.

## Fair DFS & BFS (Fair Disjunction)

Strategies with fair disjunctions provide an even stronger guarantee. That is 
resources are allocated evenly to every line in the same conde. 
Thus, the answers appear in a more easily grokked order.

=== Implementations of Strategies ===

Now let's turn to the implementations of the three depth-first search 
strategies.

## Review

Before going into the details on these implementations, let's have a short 
review of these concepts. If you have any question about information on this 
slide, please feel free to ask.

A goal is a function from a state to a space. 

A state is a way to satisfy some relations.  In our strategies, every state is 
just a substitution.  In more powerful miniKanrens, for example, miniKanrens 
with symbolic constrains, the states can include other information.

A search space, or a space for short, is a collection of states.  Spaces are 
the same as streams in the little yellow-green book for now.

## (Search) Space

Spaces play a very important role in the implementations of the strategies. 
 
So let me elaborate more on that.

A space is either 

  the empty list,

  a suspension, which is represented by a thunk, or
  
  a pair of a state and a space.
  
All of our strategies share the same Space structure.  But we reformulate our 
space representation in our implementation of BFS to improve execution time. 
This representation, however, produces the same values in the same order.  So, 
for now, a space is just a stream.  More details can be found in the paper.

(next slides)

We visualize spaces like the following diagrams.

In this diagram, the space starts with a pair.  The left-most white square 
represents a state, the first part of the pair. And everything after it is in 
the second part of the pair.  Every square in our diagrams represents a state. 

Here, the first state is followed by a gray rectangle, which means everything 
after it is in a suspension.  

Within the suspension, there are two more states followed by a black rectangle. 
The black rectangle represents the empty list and terminates the space.

(next slides)

The next diagram shows a possibly infinite space. Although spaces can be 
infinitely large, the number of squares between any two gray rectangles is 
always finite.

## Implementation of Unfair Disjunction

Now, going back to the implementations.  I'd like to start with the 
implementation of unfair disjunction.  This is the strategy in the 
little yellow-green book.

Say we have a conde expression with five lines. Each line corresponds to a 
search space. A disjunction combines these five spaces into one.

The implementation of the unfair disjunction combines these spaces 
right-associatively, which is visualized by the binary tree in the left side.

Let's zoom in to see what happens.

(next slide)

(next slide)

When we combine two search spaces, we copy the first few states in the 
first space, up to the first suspension,

(next slide)

then copy the first few states of the second space, also up to the first 
suspension.

(next slide)

and so on...

(next slide)

So the resulting space would be a fair mixture of two input spaces.

(next slide)

But because the whole tree is unbalanced, half of states are from the first 
space, and the other half from the remaining spaces.

(next slide)

This definition shows how two spaces are combined in the little yellow-green 
book. The first cond-line allows us to terminate when a space is 
empty. And the second line copies the beginning states. The last line handles 
suspensions, where the positions of the two spaces are swapped.

## Implementation of Almost-fair Disjunction

Moving on to the implementation of almost-fair disjunction.  This strategy is 
new.

It shares the same `append-inf' but uses it differently. We saw an unbalanced 
binary tree in the previous example. Here we construct a similar but balanced 
binary tree. 

The way we construct the balanced tree is to separate all spaces into two parts 
of roughly the same size. We place spaces that correspond to odd line-numbers 
in one part and the other lines in the other part. By doing this recursively, we 
get a balanced tree.

(next slide)

Now I can explain why we got so few lambdas in the example.

The lambda line is at line 1. And 1 is an odd number. After the first 
partition, the lambda is still at line 1. And so on. So this line is allocated 
the least amount of resources.

## Implementation of Fair Disjunction

Fair disjunction, as we have seen in the repeato examples, would collect all 
beginning states together. Its implementation uses a fair version of append-inf.

(next slide)

In the first two cond-lines, this version is similar to the previous one.

(next slide)

The first time we reach the `s?' line, we know that `s?' is #t and `s-inf' and 
`t-inf' haven't been swapped. So we swap them and change `s?' to #f forever.

(next slide)

When the fourth and last line runs, we know that both `s-inf' and `t-inf' end 
with a suspension, and that we have swapped them. In this case, we construct a 
new suspension. The new suspension swaps back the two spaces in the recursive 
call to loop.

## Implementation of Conjunctions

Now let's talk about fairness in conjunction.

Fairness in conjunctions is a bit different from fairness in disjunctions.  
When we consider fairness in disjunctions, what we are looking for is fair 
multi-arity disjunction because conde can have multiple lines and we want to 
say something about these lines.  In the case of conjunctions, however, we only 
care about binary conjunction.

A binary conjunction has two relations to satisfy.

(next slide)

In the left side of the diagram, the space labeled with g1 is the result 
of satisfying the first conjunct, g1. We want to search for states that also
satisfy the second conjunct. So we have more spaces to the right. 

(next slide)

(next slide)

(next slide)

Every one of these spaces corresponds to a state in the g1 space.

Every state on the right side satisfies both relations, thus they 
comprise a solution to this conjunction.

A conjunction implementation needs to combine spaces on the right side into one 
space.

The key point of fair conjunction is to combine spaces of the same color just 
like how we implemented fair disjunction.

(next slide)

This definition shows how conjunction is implemented in the little 
yellow-green book.

(next slide)

To implement fair conjunction, all we have to do is to replace the only use of 
`append-inf' with `append-inf/fair'.

=== Conclusion ===

Now let's move to the conclusion.

## Quantitative Evaluation

Here are some of our benchmarks. We are showing them to argue that 
strategies with fair or almost-fair disjunction are more resistant to 
permutation of conde-lines. 

The first two benchmarks, quine-1 and quine-2, are about generating 3 quines 
with a relational interpreter. Their interpreters order conde-lines 
differently. Interleaving DFS and balanced interleaving DFS have similar 
performance. Fair DFS is the most stable and the most efficient of the DFS 
strategies. The two BFS implementations consume too much memory. So we don't 
have execution times for them.

The next two benchmarks are about synthesizing expressions that reduce to the 
list '(I love you). Our timing shows that all strategies with fair or 
almost-fair disjunction are more stable than the interleaving DFS.

Our implementation of BFS, BFSimp, is faster than the earlier one, BFSser.

## Conclusion

Let's wrap it up. We have three reasons why we want fairness.

First, the performance of search strategies with fair or almost-fair  
disjunction is more resistant to playing the game of permuting conde lines.

It follows that beginners need not be concerned about conde-line order as much 
as they were.

And miniKanren programmers sometimes run a relation in several modes.
But the optimal orders for each mode can be different.  Then, fair
strategies allow using one definition for different running modes while having 
more acceptable performance.

Besides, as we have seen in the repeato examples, fair strategies can 
sometimes generate answers in a more understandable sequence.

=== Q & A ===

That's all. Thank you!
